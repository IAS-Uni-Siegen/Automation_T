				\item<2-> Have a long history of development- started with the invention of vaccum tube or Thermionic valve in 1904 by J.A. Fleming.
				\item<3-> The first transistor was invented in 1947 by J.Bardeen, W.H. Brattain and W.S. Shockley in Bell Labs.
				\item<4-> The first integrated circuit was invented in 1958 by J. Kilby and R. Noyce -- On and it goes
%				\item<5-> The first microprocessor was invented in 1971 by F. Faggin, T. Klein and H. Hoff in Intel.
%				\item<6-> The first microcontroller was invented in 1971 by F. Faggin, T. Klein and H. Hoff in Intel.
%				\item<7-> On and it goes- every day new devices are invented and developed.

%% Necessary prior knowledge %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Necessary prior knowledge for this course}
	You should have a basic understanding of the following topics:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Basic electrical engineering knowledge (e.g., Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws, etc.)
		\item Basic understanding of physics in electronics
		\item Algebra and complex numbers
		\item Basic signal theory knowledge (e.g., Fourier series, Laplace transform)
		\item No advanced knowledge of semiconductors or programming is needed â€” this course builds those concepts from scratch and applies them to real systems.
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\onslide<2->What we will \underline{not} cover, but you do not need to know (covered in separate courses):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Power converter circuits and topologies.
		\item Power electronics in depth involving analysis and controller design. 
	\end{itemize}
